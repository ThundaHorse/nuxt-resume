          My name is Abraham Kim. I put pieces of the web together. I'm a
          software engineer who crafts precise and aesthetically pleasing web
          apps. Exploring new languages and frameworks is what I enjoy among
          many other things. I like to focus on making sure my work is
          thouroughly tested and fit to be scaled and maintained. Honing my
          skills to create efficient and concise code is my goal.
